## Installation

The Hiphops desktop app is available for MacOS and the latest version can be [downloaded here](https://storage.googleapis.com/hiphops-live-desktop-releases/Hiphops.dmg)

Now just grab your key from your account page and add it to Hiphops. This will connect your app to your account, so you're ready to start running automations!

!> Important: Keep your account key safe. It should only be shared with trusted users that require privileges to create automations for your connected apps.

## Run the starter automation

Hiphops comes with a built in starter automation to show you how it works. Just follow the step by step instructions to run it and make a few edits.

After that, you'll see that the `New Automation` screen comes with a selection of templates you can install, run and edit. These are a great way to get started and see what is possible.

## Connecting apps

Most automations you'll want to create and use will involve other products. e.g. sending notifications on Slack or creating a release on GitHub.

Hiphops makes it easy to add these capabilities in a few clicks with apps. You can connect apps via the UI on your account page. Once connected, you'll have credential-free access allowing you to call these services within your automations.
