## Installation

<!-- Setting up Hiphops is straighforward. You will need a GitHub account and around 2 minutes.

1. Sign up here :point_right: [app.hiphops.io](https://app.hiphops.io)
2. If you signed in with anything other than GitHub, you also need to [connect your personal GitHub account](https://app.hiphops.io/account)
    > We only use your personal GitHub auth to connect you to your GitHub installation and set up your project. The GitHub installation you create next handles all the privileged access.
3. Install the GitHub app by clicking 'Add project' on the [project page](https://app.hiphops.io/projects). Make sure to select the correct org/account when installing.

?> Integrating with GitHub will become optional in a future release, but for now it remains a required step in creating a new project. -->

## Quickstart

<!-- Decide which branch/repo you want to store your config. You config will be in a file named `hiphops.yaml` which you place in the root of a repository owned by a connected GitHub account.

Now add the branch/repo name in your project settings.

Finally, create the config file in the repo and branch you specified. Hiphops will automatically detect and apply changes with no further setup required.

If no custom config is set, the default pipeline matches all changes, runs analysis and stores the result, but takes no further action.

> Note the extension must be `.yaml` or `.yml`, not variations thereof -->

### Hello world

<!-- What docs would be complete without a nice hello world to get you started?

```yaml
---
id: Hello world
resource: sensor
tasks:
- name: slack.post_message
  input:
    channel: "general"
    text: "Hello world!"
``` -->

## What next?

<!-- - Read about the core Hiphops [concepts](concepts.md#sensors)
- To customise what events are captured and create some automations, check out the [config docs](syntax.md#sensor)
- See what you can do with Hiphops through [example configs](simple-recipes.md#simple-recipes) -->
