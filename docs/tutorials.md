## Creating custom ChatOps commands

ChatOps can be used to create superb developer experiences and save your team's time.

Wrapping multi-stage processes behind a single command that devs can trigger right from the place they're having discussions is super powerful. Ordinarly these flows take a lot of effort to wire together in a robust way.

Using Hiphops means Slack and GitHub are integrated instantly without managing secrets or parsing their APIs. You also get async flows with retries and a UI for observability.

## Creating branch flow rules

Most teams have a defined flow between branches that changes should follow.

It may be as simple as `release/*` branches flow into `main` or follow a more complex environment per-branch flow.

In either case, it's useful to define this and help developers avoid accidentally breaking that process.
